# Smart-Home-Lighting-Control-System-In-ESP-8266
This project features a Smart Home Lighting Control System built using the ESP8266 microcontroller. The system integrates an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) for ambient light detection and an LED for lighting control.
# Aim
To interface an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) with an ESP8266 and create a system with both Automatic and Manual modes,
# Components
* ESP 8266
* LDR
# Connetion
